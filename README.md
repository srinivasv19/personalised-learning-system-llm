This paper introduces a novel Personalized Learning System (PLS) designed to revolutionize college exam preparation. By harnessing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), the PLS offers a comprehensive suite of tools aimed at optimizing student learning outcomes and enhancing overall exam readiness. The core functionalities of the PLS encompass three primary components: intelligent question answering, syllabus summarization, and self-evaluation. The system's ability to accurately extract and process information from diverse book PDFs empowers it to generate precise and informative answers to student queries, fostering a deeper understanding of complex subjects. Furthermore, the PLS efficiently condenses voluminous textbooks into concise syllabus summaries, providing students with a streamlined overview of essential topics. To facilitate self-assessment, the system generates a variety of multiple-choice question. A crucial aspect of exam preparation is the availability of practice materials. The PLS addresses this need by offering access to past question papers complete with comprehensive answer keys. This enables students to familiarize themselves with exam patterns, time management strategies, and the expected level of detail in their responses. The integration of these features within a single platform creates a powerful and efficient learning environment. By providing personalized support, tailored feedback, and ample practice opportunities, the PLS empowers students to take control of their learning journey and achieve academic success.
